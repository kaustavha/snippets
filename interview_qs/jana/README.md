## Jana interview question

This was a rather time consuming interview question, I am saving the code and steps here in case I need to do something similiar or anything in python later. 

Q: Write code in python to call my phone at x pm on xx/xx/xx and read the first line of reddit. You should use the twilio api to make the call.
